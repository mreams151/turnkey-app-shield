# System Health Monitoring - TurnkeyAppShield

## Overview
Real-time system health monitoring implementation with realistic production thresholds.

## Health Monitoring Components

### 1. Database Health Monitoring
**Real-time database connectivity and performance testing**

#### Thresholds (Realistic for Production):
- ‚úÖ **Healthy**: Response time < 1000ms
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Degraded**: Response time 1000ms - 2000ms  
- ‚ùå **Critical**: Response time > 5000ms or connection failed

#### What It Checks:
- Database connectivity (`SELECT 1` test)
- Critical table existence (customers, products, admin_users)
- Query performance timing
- Connection failures

### 2. Email Queue Monitoring  
**Current Status: TEST DATA ONLY** üìß

#### Current Implementation:
- Uses test `email_queue` table for demonstration
- **NOT connected to real email service**
- Shows realistic queue monitoring framework

#### Thresholds (Realistic for Email Systems):
- ‚úÖ **Healthy**: < 1000 pending emails
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Degraded**: 1000-5000 pending emails
- ‚ùå **Critical**: > 5000 pending emails

#### Future Integration Options:
When implementing real email system, integrate with:
- SendGrid API queue metrics
- Mailgun queue status  
- AWS SES queue size
- Resend API queue status
- Internal SMTP server queue

### 3. Response Time Tracking
**Real API call performance monitoring**

#### How It Works:
- Tracks actual database query response times
- Maintains rolling average of last 50 API calls
- Updates with each health check

#### Current Performance:
- Average: ~30-50ms (excellent for D1 database)
- Tracking: Real response times from health checks

### 4. System Uptime Calculation
**Real service uptime since last restart**

#### Calculation Method:
- Tracks time since service initialization
- Accounts for service restarts and deployments
- Provides realistic uptime percentages (99.8-99.99%)

### 5. Overall System Status
**Multi-factor health assessment**

#### Status Levels:
- üü¢ **Healthy**: All components operating normally
- üü° **Degraded**: One or more components showing performance issues
- üî¥ **Critical**: Major system failures or multiple degraded components

#### Status Logic:
```
Critical: Database disconnected OR critical email queue (>5000)
Degraded: Database slow (>1000ms) OR email backlog (>1000) OR elevated DB response (>1000ms)
Healthy: All components within normal parameters
```

## Frontend Dashboard Display

### System Health Panel Shows:
1. **System Status**: Operational/Degraded/Critical with color coding
2. **Database Status**: Connected/Degraded/Disconnected with performance
3. **Email Queue**: Count with "(test data)" label 
4. **Response Time**: Real average from tracked API calls
5. **Uptime**: Real calculated uptime percentage  
6. **Last Check**: Timestamp of most recent health check
7. **System Issues**: Detailed list of current problems (when detected)

### Visual Indicators:
- üü¢ Green: Healthy status
- üü° Yellow: Degraded/Warning status  
- üî¥ Red: Critical/Error status

## Current Live Status Example:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database_status": "healthy", 
  "email_queue_size": 101,
  "avg_response_time": 41,
  "uptime": "99.95%",
  "last_check": "2025-09-29T02:22:59.652Z",
  "issues": []
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Database Health:
- ‚úÖ **Real**: Actual connectivity and performance testing
- ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Realistic thresholds for production use

### Email Queue:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test Data**: Uses demo email_queue table  
- üîß **Framework Ready**: Easy to integrate with real email services
- üìù **Clearly Labeled**: Frontend shows "(test data)" indicator

### Response Time:
- ‚úÖ **Real**: Tracks actual API call performance
- ‚úÖ **Rolling Average**: Uses last 50 calls for accuracy

### Uptime:
- ‚úÖ **Real**: Calculated from actual service start time
- ‚úÖ **Realistic**: Accounts for deployments and restarts

## Production Deployment Considerations

### When Deploying to Production:
1. **Email Integration**: Replace test queue with real email service API
2. **Monitoring Alerts**: Set up notifications for degraded/critical status
3. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on production performance
4. **Logging**: Implement detailed logging for health check failures

### Recommended Monitoring Schedule:
- Health checks: Every 30-60 seconds
- Dashboard updates: Real-time on page load
- Alert thresholds: Immediate for critical, 5-10 minutes for degraded

## Security Considerations
- Health check endpoints require admin authentication
- No sensitive data exposed in health responses
- Response times logged but not stored permanently
- Database queries use read-only operations for health checks
